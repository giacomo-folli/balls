# Balls

This project is a simulation of bouncing balls created with the `nannou` crate. It's a simple project to to learn some basic physics and graphics concepts.

Here's a quick look at the simulation in action:

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Rust installed. You can download it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
2.  Clone the repository.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.
4.  Run the project using `cargo run`.

## Controls

- `R`: Add vertical velocity to all balls.
- `Down`: Decrease the radius of the balls.
- `Up`: Increase the radius of the balls.
- `Left`: Remove a ball.
- `Right`: Add a ball.
